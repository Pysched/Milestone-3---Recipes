# Milestone-3-CookBook
This is a project to develop a cookbook recipe site. The site will contain a repository of recipes created by the users of the site. From the landing page users will be able to browze and search for different types of recipes as they wish. This will be achieved by the categorization of the recipes into different and relateable sections/categories as defined below. 

To add recipes to the site users will need to register for this permission, using a login name and password and also providing account details information.

By being signed up the users will also have additional features usch as:
--- Being able to comment on other users recipes
--- Adding recipes and comments
--- Updating their own recipes
--- Deleting recipes and comments
--- Voting on recipes and comments
--- Liking recipes
--- Viewing their favourited recipes

Users who are not signed up, can view all material, recipes instructions etc however hey will not be able to like, vote, make comments, add or delete recipes.

This is the overall premise of the site.

# How this will be achieved
The site will be developed using the following technologes
--- HTML - Base structure of the site
--- CSS - Styling of the site
--- JS - Dynamic interactions on the site
--- PyMongo - Database connection
--- Python - user input
--- flask
--- heroku
--- Mongodb
